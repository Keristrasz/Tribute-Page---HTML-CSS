        <h3>The story of Karel Janousek</h3>
        <p>
          Karel Janoušek, KCB (30 October 1893 – 27 October 1971) was a senior
          Czechoslovak Air Force officer. He began his career as a soldier,
          serving in the Austrian Imperial-Royal Landwehr 1915–16, Czechoslovak
          Legion 1916–20 and Czechoslovak Army 1920–24.
        </p>

        <p>
          With major battles between the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian armies
          soon ravaging the Eastern Front, turning the fields of Galicia into a
          graveyard for hundreds of thousands of young men, the empire’s war
          effort was close to collapse. In desperate need of fresh recruits to
          bolster the ranks, Karel Janousek was conscripted into the army in
          June 1915. After completing his training in the 57th Imperial Royal
          Landwehr Regiment, he was sent away from the Eastern Front to the
          newly opened Italian Front. This was because of his Czech heritage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even the possibly unreliable Czechs had to be pulled away to fight the
          Russian steamroller, which was very close to knocking the Austrians
          out of the war. Sometime around July 2, 1916, the high water mark of
          the offensive, Janousek was captured by the advancing Russians and
          sent to a Prisoner of War camp in Ukraine.
        </p>

        <h3>Switching sides</h3>
        <p>
          Russian High Command was well aware of the political discontent of the
          Czechs, Slovaks and other Slavic soldiers serving in the
          Austro-Hungarian army, and planned on turning those men against their
          former emperor. Janousek, like many other captured Czechs, took up the
          offer to switch sides in the hope that after the war, they might be
          allowed to rule their own country. On August 1, he joined the II
          Volunteer Division of the Serbian Army in Odessa, and in October 1916
          became part of a Czechoslovak Volunteer Rifle Regiment north of Kiev.
          After Russia’s February Revolution in 1917, the Russian army slowly
          but surely disintegrated, and as Janousek’s unit was transferred to
          the front in July 1917, many Russian soldiers were simply deserting.
          But the Czechs and Slovaks remained, believing in their cause.
        </p>
        <h3>PR victory</h3>
        <p>
          In the battle of Zborov they proved their worth, breaking through the
          Austro-Hungarian lines on a broad front and taking hundreds of
          prisoners in the process. It became a huge PR victory too, and the
          beginning of the legend that was the Czechoslovak Legion. Janousek
          himself was wounded on July 18 and did not see further action until
          after the October Revolution tore Russia apart. The anti-Bolshevik
          faction of the Legion refused then to surrender their arms. Fearing
          for their lives, they were forced to become involved in the Russian
          Civil War. Since the way to the west was blocked by both Bolsheviks
          and Austria-Hungary, they captured an armoured train and fought their
          way east to the Pacific and all the way around the globe, until they
          finally made it to Prague in February 1920. The mythos of the Legion
          and the overall Czechoslovak army was an integral part of the new
          state that was Czechoslovakia, and Janousek remained close to the
          army.
        </p>
        <h3>Taking to the skies</h3>
        <p>
          After he had graduated from the War College in 1923, Janousek joined
          the new Czechoslovak air force and began training as pilot. Soon he
          was commander of an air-reconnaissance course at Cheb in Bohemia,
          where he became fascinated with meteorology and wanted to find out how
          reduce the impact of bad weather on aircraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was additionally fascinated by the doctrines of the Italian
          theorist Giulio Douhet. On aerial warfare, Douhet wrote: “There is no
          need for defensive tactics, since the skies are vast and you can’t
          build trenches like on the ground. The bomber will always get through,
          so the only option left is the offensive.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Janousek taught Douhet’s theories on aerial superiority and how to
          maintain an aggressive spirit in the skies. As he studied further at
          Prague university in 1936, Nazi Germany set its sights on the
          Czechoslovak state. The dissolution of that state and its armies
          followed the German occupation in March 1939, which forced Janousek
          and hundreds of defiant soldiers and officers to escape from Nazi
          rule..
        </p>
        <h3>The Czechoslovak Air Force</h3>
        <p>
          With the help of the underground resistance ring Obrana národa,
          Janousek fled to France, travelling though Greece and French Lebanon,
          reaching Paris in December 1939. He immediately got in contact with
          the French government and other Czech officers, trying to create a
          united Czechoslovak Air Force. But like the rest of the French army at
          the time, his plans were hindered by logistical and leadership
          deficiencies within the French army until it was too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the face of the German invasion in June 1940, Janousek fled once
          more, this time via a Dutch ship to England. The British high command
          was better organised, particularly with regard to their air force, but
          Janousek and the other officers still had to jump through a lot of
          diplomatic hoops until they were able to convince Winston Churchill
          and co of their value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once established, the free Czechoslovak Air Force became a strong
          asset to the defence of the island. Fighting in Royal Air Force
          uniforms and planes, they fought the Germans throughout the Battle of
          Britain. The experienced Czechoslovak fighter pilots were awarded many
          medals. Janousek especially, although disliked by many of his
          superiors, had been very much valued by the British as the best Czech
          commander around. By 1941, the Czechoslovak Air Force had over 1,600
          active service members.
        </p>
        <h3>Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</h3>
        <p>
          Janousek was a masterful organiser, and as Air Vice-Marshall spent
          much time overseeing the squadrons and their training, he made several
          trips to Canada and the US to teach there and was even knighted by
          King George VI as Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a speech to the British people, he emphasised that in their common
          fight against fascism, it was the qualities of: “liberty, decency,
          kindness and common sense” that made life worth living.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his fame did not escape his enemies’ attention. Back in occupied
          Czechoslovakia, the Nazis killed his wife and a sister, and one of his
          brothers perished in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and
          Buchenwald. Many others from his large family were jailed and tortured
          in order to get information about him and the Czech resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          After five years of fighting for a different country in a foreign
          uniform, the war came to a close and it was time return home. But the
          journey home was problematic. As the Americans withdrew westward, all
          of Czechoslovakia fell under the Soviet zone of influence. Relocating
          British fighter squadrons back to Prague was already a diplomatic
          nightmare, yet still, by August 1945, Janousek and his men were
          allowed to return to their home country as the official Czech Air
          Force.
        </p>
        <h3>A threat to the regime</h3>
        <p>
          However, even though the Nazis were gone, the country was by no means
          free. The supposed alliance between the Soviets and the Western Allies
          was breaking apart mere months after the end of the 3rd Reich. The
          Czech Communist secret service monitored every step Janousek and his
          pilots made. Every man who had fought for the western Allies was now
          suspicious, especially Karel Janousek, who kept in contact with the
          British. He was put on a list of potential threats to the regime. The
          situation worsened dramatically after the coup of the Czech communists
          in February 1948. Backed by the Soviets, a wave of terror and
          persecution swept through the country. Tens of thousands were
          condemned in political show trials, and around 6,500 of them were
          executed, although the exact number is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Janousek lost his job, and as it was fruitless for him to find any new
          position in the military. He decided to flee the country once again,
          but this time his escape attempt was betrayed by a double agent. He
          was arrested and quickly court-martialled as a traitor and deserter.
          The communists stripped him of everything – his rank, his awards and
          even his doctorate – and sentenced him to 18 years in prison. While in
          prison, a guard offered to help him flee, but although Janousek
          refused, his sentence was increased to life in prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1955, the political mood shifted again, and Janousek’s prison
          sentence was reduced to 25 years. He would finally receive an amnesty
          in 1960. After the Prague Spring in 1968, Janousek was rehabilitated
          but, it would take another 22 years until his rank and awards were
          restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Janousek passed away before that happened, on October 27, 1971. After
          the fall of the Czechoslovak communist regime, he was posthumously
          promoted to general and all of his 40 awards, British, French, Russian
          and from many other countries, were officially returned. His service
          and sacrifices were honoured once again.
